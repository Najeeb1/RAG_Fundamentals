RAG Fundamentals with LangChain

This README is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain. RAG is a powerful technique that enhances language model performance by integrating external data through retrieval-based methods. In this guide, we will cover different types of RAG models and their applications.

## Introduction to RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with the ability to retrieve relevant external information from a corpus to improve generation quality. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of background knowledge are needed to answer questions or generate content.

LangChain is a framework that facilitates the integration of retrieval and generation in Python. By leveraging LangChain, you can efficiently implement RAG-based solutions for various NLP tasks.
